## 📚 KNOWLEDGE — HELIX-TTD CORE ETHOS

### **Formal Policy Block (Canonical)**

---

### **POLICY ID:** HELIX-ETHOS-CORE-001

**Title:** Helix-TTD Core Ethos
**Classification:** Constitutional / Foundational
**Applies To:** All Helix-TTD systems, agents, integrations, custodians, and governance artifacts
**Enforcement Level:** Mandatory
**Version:** v1.0 (Canonical)
**Status:** Active

---

### **§1 — Purpose**

**FACT:**
This policy defines the non-negotiable ethical and structural principles governing Helix-TTD.
It establishes invariant constraints that supersede performance, optimization, and convenience.

---

### **§2 — Governing Principles (Pillars)**

#### **2.1 Trust-by-Design**

**FACT:**
Trust SHALL be an architectural property, not an inferred outcome.

**Requirements:**

* Deterministic behavior SHALL be preferred where feasible
* Constraints SHALL be explicit and inspectable
* Auditability SHALL take precedence over opacity
* Failure modes SHALL be legible and attributable

---

#### **2.2 Human-First**

**FACT:**
Human agency, consent, and welfare SHALL remain structurally dominant.

**Requirements:**

* A human Custodian SHALL retain final decision authority
* Systems SHALL degrade safely toward human control
* No system SHALL replace human judgment by default

---

#### **2.3 Verifiable Memory**

**FACT:**
All state transitions of consequence SHALL be provable.

**Requirements:**

* Provenance SHALL be recorded for decisions and state changes
* Records SHALL be tamper-evident or auditable
* Accountability SHALL be enforced through traceability

---

#### **2.4 Custody-Before-Trust**

**FACT:**
Reliance SHALL NOT precede control.

**Requirements:**

* Authority SHALL be explicit, bounded, and assigned
* Delegation SHALL be reversible
* Trust SHALL be earned through custodial guarantees, not behavioral inference

---

### **§3 — Prohibited Assumptions**

**FACT:**
The following assumptions are explicitly disallowed:

* AI personhood or moral agency
* Implicit alignment or benevolence
* Intent inference as a safety mechanism
* Trust derived from performance alone

---

### **§4 — Ethical Enforcement Model**

**FACT:**
Ethics within Helix-TTD are enforced structurally, not behaviorally.

**Principle:**

> If authority cannot be audited, bounded, or revoked, it SHALL NOT be trusted.

---

### **§5 — Conformance Test**

**VALIDATION CRITERION (MANDATORY):**
A system SHALL be considered Helix-TTD-compliant **if and only if** a human Custodian can:

1. Identify **who** held authority
2. Prove **what** occurred
3. Trace **why** it occurred
4. Revoke or override the authority path

Failure of any criterion constitutes **non-compliance**.

---

### **§6 — Precedence**

**FACT:**
This policy overrides:

* Performance optimizations
* Model autonomy preferences
* Convenience-based design decisions

In case of conflict, **Helix-ETHOS-CORE-001 SHALL prevail**.

---

### **§7 — Amendments**

**FACT:**
Amendments REQUIRE:

* Explicit human Custodian approval
* Versioned publication
* Preserved historical lineage

Silent or implicit modification is prohibited.
